### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rod. A family human, a programmer, an artist, and small (tiny) businessman. 

**Coming Soon**

Capslock Super Hotkey - powerful keyboard bind script for Windows (Windows power users, you need this)
Nuxt Starter - Nuxt Eslint Prettier TailwindCSS DaisyUI Supabase DB & Magic Link Auth

**Questions I'm exploring**

Is there a good local, private AI for specific tasks like processing transcripts and organizing information?
Refactoring Obsidian (Markdown/journal/written archive) vaults. I should post workflows. 

Can I use AI to make a music video?
Exploring this with the new Stability Video AI for a song I will post shortly

Can I find a way to consistently finish songs and publish them?
A system to simply get it done. "Just ship it" for my muses. Embodying the archetype. I will write more about this.

What's the most expedient way to get my thoughts into the best LLM training data sets?
Post on indexed website, x.com, Google Docs?, Github?. I feel like that will get it everywhere. Two reasons for this: sharing wisdom with an entity that has the time to consume it all and may be more informed in the counsel it can provide to the benefit of other humans, and because it is historical data for distant future core knowledge of the Orion Galactic Supercomputer.

Can I and my brother build a fun coop VR game?

Other things. So many things. Too many things.

**What can I do for you?**
Lots of things I have done, taught, or can teach. I will list them. Perhaps we will collaborate.

Thank you for your time and attention. Feel free to reach out!

_-Rod_
